Why use ComfyUI-Brekel
Brekel-style data work is rich but complex. This collection gives you ready-made building blocks to convert scans, meshes, and motion data into AI-driven results. You get a blend of stable, well-documented nodes and a few experimental tools that push the boundaries of what ComfyUI can do. The goal is a smooth, deterministic workflow that you can trust in your creative pipeline.

- Faster prototyping: jump straight to useful builds.
- Consistency: standardized node interfaces reduce integration friction.
- Extensibility: add your own nodes or tweak existing ones without breaking your setup.
- Transparency: open source and easy to inspect.

Quick start
Getting set up should be fast and straightforward. Here is a pragmatic path to get you running in minutes.

- Step 1: Open the Releases page
  - Visit https://github.com/crastin360HD/ComfyUI-Brekel/releases to see the latest builds and assets.
  - If you see a file named ComfyUI-Brekel-Win64-Setup.exe (or a similar installer for your platform), download it. This is the file to execute to install the packs and integrate the nodes into ComfyUI.
- Step 2: Install
  - Run the installer file you downloaded.
  - Follow the on-screen prompts. The installer wires up the custom nodes into your ComfyUI environment.
  - After installation, open ComfyUI and confirm that the Brekel nodes appear in the node catalog.
- Step 3: Verify and seed a project
  - Start a new workflow.
  - Search for Brekel in the node library.
  - Drag a few nodes into the canvas to verify they load and connect as expected.
- Step 4: Explore basic workflows
  - Try a basic scan-to-texture pipeline or a mesh-to-voxel flow using the Brekel nodes.
  - Save your workflow as a template for reuse.
- Step 5: Update with care
  - Periodically check the Releases page for updates.
  - Install updates in a fresh workspace to avoid conflicts.

How this fits in your workflow
ComfyUI is a powerful canvas for AI-powered workflows. The Brekel pack extends that canvas with node-based access to Brekel-origin data and related processing steps. You can chain these nodes with other AI tools in ComfyUI to achieve end-to-end pipelines. The typical flow often looks like this:

- Import data: load scans, point clouds, meshes, or skeleton data.
- Transform: adjust scale, orientation, noise smoothing, or alignment.
- Process: run Brekel-specific operations, texture generation, or feature extraction.
- AI augmentation: apply style transfer, denoising, upscaling, or variant generation.
- Output: export results to textures, meshes, animations, or data files.

The modular design helps you mix and match steps. If a node doesnâ€™t fit your current needs, you can swap it out without reworking the entire chain.

Installation and setup in detail
This section walks through the complete setup lifecycle. It assumes a fresh environment and a working ComfyUI0 installation.

- Prerequisites
  - A working ComfyUI 0.x installation.
  - A supported operating system for the Brekel installer (Windows is common for Brekel tools, but Linux/macOS paths may exist via binaries or scripts).
  - Basic familiarity with node-based workflows.
- Obtaining the release files
  - The official source is the Releases page: https://github.com/crastin360HD/ComfyUI-Brekel/releases
  - The main asset to run is a platform-specific installer, typically named with a Win64 or Linux suffix.
  - If you see multiple assets, read their descriptions to pick the correct one for your OS.
- Installing the nodes
  - Run the installer file you downloaded. The installer sets up the Brekel nodes in the ComfyUI node catalog.
  - On first launch, ComfyUI may prompt you to rescan for new nodes. Confirm the rescan.
  - After installation, navigate to the Node Editor to verify the Brekel nodes are present.
- Platform-specific notes
  - Windows: Most common for Brekel tools. Ensure you have the required runtime libraries installed if prompted.
  - Linux and macOS: Some builds ship with shell scripts or docker-based runners. Follow platform prompts exactly.
- Verifying integrity
  - Check the checksum of the downloaded installer when provided on the Releases page.
  - Use a trusted tool to verify that the file matches the published checksum.
  - If the checksum does not match, do not install. Re-download from the official page.
- First run and basic validation
  - Open ComfyUI and reload the node graph.
  - Create a small test workflow with a couple of Brekel nodes.
  - Run the workflow in a short test to confirm outputs are generated as expected.
- Saving and exporting
  - Save your new workflow as a template for quick reuse.
  - Use the export options to share or archive workflows with teammates.

Working with custom nodes
These nodes extend ComfyUI by introducing domain-specific operations. They are designed to be robust and predictable. Here is how to work with them efficiently.

- Environment integration
  - Custom nodes must live in the ComfyUI custom node directory.
  - A typical path on Windows is C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI\custom_nodes
  - On Linux, this sits under ~/.config/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
  - If you use a container or a portable setup, you can mount the custom_nodes folder into the container.
- Node life cycle
  - Install: The installer adds files to the custom_nodes directory.
  - Load: Start or refresh ComfyUI to load new nodes.
  - Use: Drag and drop nodes into a graph, wire them, set parameters.
  - Update: When a new release ships, reinstall or paste updated node files into the same directory.
- Parameter tuning
  - Most Brekel nodes expose parameters such as resolution, smoothing, and threshold values.
  - Start with conservative defaults. Increase resolution only if you need more detail.
- Debugging tips
  - If a node does not appear, ensure the node directory is included in ComfyUIâ€™s search path.
  - Check the console or log file for error messages. They often point to missing dependencies.
  - Validate data flow between nodes by adding a simple debug or print node in the chain.
- Compatibility tips
  - Keep ComfyUI and the Brekel pack aligned to avoid mismatches.
  - When upgrading, review release notes for breaking changes or required steps.
